A tiny WPF interface that integrates [Azure cognitive service](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesSpeechServices) with [GPT endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource). This requires Azure subscription resources of both speech service and OpenAI.

### Interactive Mode

Simply type or speak (via microphone) to ask GTP questions in this mode. Press the "start button" to trigger a speech QA session, and click the "start/stop button" again to pause.

### Translation Mode

This is the real time translation (into Chinese) functionality. Result texts will also be displayed as a 3-second toast in the bottom corner, so the app can be run completely in the background.

An audio redirection (from speacker to input) interface is a prerequisite to use the feature. Windows stereo mix or [VoiceMeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/) is probably a good choice.
